# My long journey to a suitable headset

Since January 2021 I work for [Djangsters](//djangsters.de) a German
company developing Django- and Python-based software.

We work remotely, there is no office, which means a lot of video calls.

In the past I used a Plantronics Blackwire USB headset, now I was looking
for a new headset.

My requirements:

* over-ear (the Plantronics were on-ear)
* high-quality microphone. If my kids play in the room next to me, I don't want the other video call participants to hear this. Or if I type some notes during the meeting, I don't want someone to hear me typing on the keyboard. The internal microphone did not meet these requirements.
* ANC (Active Noise Canceling). Between the video calls, I listen to relaxing music (for example Santec Orchestra). Together with ANC, this helps me to focus, even if there is noise.
* Optional: without a wire.

First I tried Bose 700 (290 Eur). I have a Lenovo Yoga15 laptop running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux.

Both devices did not play well together. Listening to music was fine, but as soon as I tried to enable the microphone the audio quality reduced to an unusable level. It sounded like a gramophone.

Then I tried the Sony WH-1000XM3. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth connection was the same: Only listening to music was great, but as soon as I enabled the microphone the quality was unusable. I did some research and hear that using a USB dongle instead of the Bluetooth of my laptop could help.

I don't know what the reason was. Either the Bluetooth stack of Ubuntu Linux is only partially implemented, or the Bluetooth hardware of my Yoga15 is too old.

I ordered the 1mii USB Bluetooth adapter since it uses Bluetooth 5.0, not Bluetooth 4 like my Yoga15 laptop. This way I could avoid the Ubuntu Bluetooth Stack and the Bluetooth hardware of my Laptop.

But (short pause to increase tension)... It somehow did not work.

I sent the Dongle back.

I focused on my needs. What did I want? I want high-quality audio and a high-quality microphone. 

Bose, Sony, and other ANC headphones are consumer headphones. I want a professional headset.

The Plantronics Blackwire USB was the device of my former employer. It worked fine, except that it was an on-ear headset, and I prefer an over-ear headset.

So I ordered a Jabra Headset Evolve 80. It has a wire, but that's ok if I get high-quality audio. The Evolve80 has a long cable and in the middle of a cable is a useless adapter which gives me features I don't need. It has the usual next/prev or volume up/down buttons. This round adapter was annoying. Having a headset with a cable is ok, but this adapter was too big and too heavy.

I was frustrated. So many hours were lost looking for a suitable headset.

I took the phone and asked the professional headset seller [comhead.de](https://www.comhead.de/).

There I received the advice that the Jabra Evolve2 85 comes with a dongle which should work with Linux.

It has ANC, it is over-ear and has a microphone arm.

The audio quality of the microphone is not great. My voice sounds a bit strange (which is does not with other headsets (with cable)).

Wow, finally I found a suitable headset: The Jabra Evolve2 85 works fine. The USB adapter connects immediately to the headset. The headset has all my requirements (over-ear, ANC, high-quality microphone with a microphone boom arm). I am happy.
